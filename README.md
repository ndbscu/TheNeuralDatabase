# TheNeuralDatabase
The Neural Database (Ndb) is an alternative to neural networks. There are no similarities between
these two systems. The Ndb is designed to overcome one of the most significant problems with neural
network technology – the time and effort required to train the network. The training process develops
the intelligence of the network, but in the Ndb intelligence is already “built-in” before any data is
added to the database.

This repository contains a Neural Database application (a Win64 Console), the source code (in C),
data files for creating Ndb databases, documentation for running the application (ReadMe.txt) plus
documents with detailed descriptions of all the internals of this new technology.

The Neural Database is a research tool. Errors can easily be found in its handling of corrupted text,
and the larger the database, the slower the response time. Nevertheless, the Ndb offers a new paradigm
for a biological nervous system. Due to the speed with which it can learn new information, the Ndb may
be closer to biological reality than a neural network.
