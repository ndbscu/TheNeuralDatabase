;
;	Only data after the double-semicolons will be loaded into an Ndb
;
;	This is the minimal set of words needed for the successful recognition
;	of all the test cases in the Test Library. Every Neural Database tested
;	with the Test Library should include at least these words.
;
;	Also included in this set are all the words in the phrases that are
;	loaded into Ndb #50, making it possible to "link" the results from
;	a database with these words to inquiries into Ndb #50.
