;Neural Database data - Questions and associated Actions
;(c) Copyright 2024 Gary J. Lassiter. All Rights Reserved.
;
;	Only data after the double-semicolons will be loaded into the Ndb
;
;	This data is used to create 50.ndb in which each RN is a word and each ON is a
;	question composed from those words.
;
;	To be successfully 'chained' to 1.ndb such that the results of an inquiry into 1.ndb
;	can be used to query 50.ndb, resulting in the correct Action being executed:
;			query_text --> 1.ndb --> results --> 50.ndb --> execute Action
;	all the words in each question must be words in 1.ndb
;
;	The standard line format:  ;;question:surrogate:action,question2:surrogate2:action2,...
;
;	The numeric "ActionCode" at the beginning of each action must match the values in the
;	SWITCH statement in NdbActions.c
